# Media Sailor (msailor)

**Media Sailor (msailor)** is a versatile multimedia application designed to replace all other media apps on your computer. Our goal is to create a media app that is both highly hackable and user-friendly.

Inspired by [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), which successfully transformed VIM into a fully functional IDE and beyond, Media Sailor aims to bring similar improvements to your multimedia experience.

**WARNING:** This project is currently under heavy development. The `cargo run` command is not yet functional, and all testing is being conducted via `cargo test`.
